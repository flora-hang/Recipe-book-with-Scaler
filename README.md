# My Project- A Recipe converter

## Usage, Application, and Purpose

An *Comprehensive* answer:
- The application will take in a recipe and some amounts of ingredients at hand
. It will then pick out the limiting ingredient and produce a version of the 
original recipe, with the portion of all the ingredients adjusted according
to the limiting ingredient. So the person using the recipe can maximize their output
and save time in finding out the quantity of each ingredient needed. It could also
be used to scale up or down a recipe, for people who would like to see the numbers 
calculated for them and clearly listed.
- This maybe useful for anyone who doesn't have the exact amount of ingredients 
stated in the recipe, and wants to maximize the amount of food they make.
This could be a useful application, for people who bake or cook, or extension 
for recipe websites.
- I am a baker my self and I know how frustrating it can be to not have enough ingredients 
required by the recipe at hand. Sometimes if the proportion of the ingredients are complicated
it is hard to adjust the amount of ingredients by hand. If I were to have an application 
like this one, I could save so much time doing math calculations.
